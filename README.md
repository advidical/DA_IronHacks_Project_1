## Iron Hacks Data Analytics Spring 2024  

This is the first quest project as part of IronHacks bootcamp.
The goal of this first 'Quest' project was to build and refine a 
Text-Based Exscape Room Game using Python Data Structures, Functions,
and Control-Flow Structures (No external libraries/Engines)
We huild the project with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab in mind,
Storing the main game logic and object as Python Modules

### Installation:
Clone the Repo, then depending on how where you host the project

- Locally: Just open the folder and open the Python NB in vscode or jupyternotebook/lab, 
 then just run it

 
- Google Colab: modify COLAB_PROJECT_PATH variable in top cell to the directory 
 where you stored the project in your google drive, then mount your drive. You should then be good to run the python notebook
